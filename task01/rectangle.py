5. Create a python file named Rectangle, write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any given Rectangle

        Hint: width and length need to be given to calculate the area and perimeter of rectangle
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                    length = 5
                    width = 2

                output:
                    Area of the rectangle is equal to 10
                    Perimeter of rectangle is equal to 20
"""

length = 5
width = 2

print(f"Area of the rectangle is equal to {length * width}")
print(f"Perimeter of the rectangle is equal to {2*(length + width)}")
